            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I was born in San Diego, California where I lived for 11 years before moving north to Elk Grove, California and attended Franklin High School. Once senior year of high school ended, I decided to attend University of the Pacific in Stockton, California to pursue an undergraduate degree in Computer Science. During my time at Pacific I spent a lot of time studying, exploring Stockton, and participating as an active member of Theta Chi Fraternity.</p>
            <p>Two years into Pacific, I decided to declare a concentration in Networking and Computer Security due to my love of Information Technology and the hardware surrounding it. This passion has only been furthered by the experience I gained from working with Apple during my senior year of high school, the San Francisco Giants organization in the summer of 2014, and with Vocera Communications as a co-op in the Technical Support department in 2015.</p>
            <p>I am a hardworking, responsible, and fun individual who seeks to constantly make myself better any chance I can get because I know that there are always new things to learn and become passionate about.</p>
            <p>Hope you enjoy the site and I look forward to connecting with you.</p>
